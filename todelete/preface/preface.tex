\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis covers the ideas which were developed and tested practically on several projects. 

During the work on this thesis grid technologies exists, however a virtualization technologies as an enabling technology for a so called cloud computing becomes more available and widely used, thus a focus was given with this direction. 

The author of this thesis followed the evolution of grid infrastructure and the cloud infrastructure and were involved in works which utilizes some of the related technologies and infrastructures to fulfill the specific needs of the biomedical application.

The author's work was published in a series of peer-reviewed papers published on international conferences and journals \cite{kulhanek2009processing,kulhanekinfrastructure}.
The author work was also presented in international conferences and published in the respective proceedings
\cite{kulhanekod,kulhanekvirtualizace}
 and also popularized on the local Czech conferences and journals \cite{kulhanek2010remote,matejakmodel}.
\section{Thesis Goal}
The aim of the thesis is to investigate multidisciplinary field of biomedical informatics with special focus on distributed technologies - GRID and CLOUD with their posible impact in the field of current research in biomedicine. A contribution was made in selected area of computational physiology.

\section{Thesis Contribution}
The author claims that the following contribution was made:
\section{Thesis Structure}
