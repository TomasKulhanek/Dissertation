abstract = {We present the current state of complex circulatory dynamics model development based on Guyton's famous diagram. The aim is to provide an open-source model that will allow the simulation of a number of pathological conditions on a virtual patient including cardiac, respiratory, and kidney failure. The model will also simulate the therapeutic influence of various drugs, infusions of electrolytes, blood transfusion, etc. As a current result of implementation, we describe a core model of human physiology targeting the systemic circulation, arterial pressure and body fluid regulation, including short- and long-term regulations. The model can be used for educational purposes and general reflection on physiological regulation in pathogenesis of various diseases.},

Our main aim is to provide a novel interactive multimedia application that can be used for biomedical education where (a) simulations are combined with tutorials and (b) the presentation layer is simplified while the underlying complexity of the model is retained. The development of the Atlas required the cooperation of many professionals including teachers, system analysts, artists, and programmers. During the design of the Atlas, tools were developed that allow for component-based creation of simulation models, creation of interactive multimedia and their final coordination into a compact unit based on the given design. The Atlas is a freely available online application, which can help to explain the function of individual physiological systems and the causes and symptoms of their disorders.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The creation and exchange of biologically relevant models is of great interest to many researchers. When multiple standards are in use, models are more readily used and re-used if there exist robust translators between the various accepted formats.

SUMMARY: Antimony 2.4 and JSim 2.10 provide translation capabilities from their own formats to SBML and CellML. All provided unique challenges, stemming from differences in each format's inherent design, in addition to differences in functionality.Availability and implementation: Both programs are available under BSD licenses; Antimony from http://antimony.sourceforge.net/and JSim from http://physiome.org/jsim/.

@article{Burkhoff1993,
abstract = {One of the most important consequences of acute left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is pulmonary edema resulting from a rise in pulmonary venous pressure (PVP). It is generally believed that the PVP rise is a direct hemodynamic consequence of LVD. While this paradigm seems plausible, especially if the LV is viewed as a sump pump, there is no specific evidence to support this simple explanation. A theoretical analysis was performed to assess the hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for the dramatic rise in PVP after acute LVD. The ventricles were modeled as time-varying elastances; pulmonary and systemic vascular systems were modeled as series of resistive and capacitive elements. In response to a 50\% decrease in LV contractile strength [end-systolic elastance (Ees)], cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped substantially, while PVP increased minimally from its baseline of 12 to approximately 15 mmHg. With LV Ees set at 50\% of normal, the effects of sympathetic activation were tested. When heart rate and total peripheral resistance were increased, CO and MAP improved, yet PVP still did not rise. The only intervention that caused a substantial increase in PVP was to simulate the decrease in unstressed volume (VU) of the venous system known to occur with sympathetic activation. When VU was decreased by about 15-20\% (comparable to experimentally observed shifts with acute heart failure), PVP increased above 25 mmHg. The effects of pericardial constraints were investigated, and the results suggest a major role of this organ in determining the overall hemodynamic response to acute LVD, sympathetic activation, and explaining the responses to therapy. Thus this analysis suggests that elevations of PVP do not occur simply as a direct hemodynamic consequence of acute LVD. Rather, changes in PVP may be dictated more by sympathetic control on venous capacity. If confirmed, recognition of this as a primary mechanism may prove important in directing development of new therapies and in understanding the mechanisms of disease progression in heart failure.},

abstract = {Because of close anatomic association, the pressure and volume in one ventricle can directly influence the pressure and volume in the opposite ventricle. To examine the importance of ventricular interdependence in controlling the circulation, we developed a computer model in which ventricular interdependence could be turned on and off. Left ventricular chamber contractility, as judged by maximal elastance (Emax), was enhanced on the order of 10\% as a result of ventricular interaction, whereas right ventricular Emax was affected by as much as 60\% under physiological conditions. With increases in systemic vascular resistance, ventricular interaction caused a smaller stroke volume (SV) decrease than with no interaction. For canine data (SV = 21.4 ml), doubling systemic vascular resistance decreased SV by 3.7 without ventricular interdependence, 3.5 with diastolic ventricular interdependence, and 3.3 ml with diastolic and systolic ventricular interdependence. In contrast, with increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, ventricular interaction caused a greater decrease in SV than with no interaction present. Decreasing left ventricular free wall elastance or right ventricular free wall elastance decreased SV. Diastolic ventricular interdependence reduced the SV changes, whereas systolic ventricular interdependence accentuated the SV changes with alterations in right and left ventricular free-wall elastance. The results of the present simulation demonstrate the importance of ventricular interdependence in the observed responses of the right ventricle to volume overload, pressure overload, and ischemia.},

In a previous study, we described a model for educational simulation of infant cardiovascular physiology. Using essentially the same methodology, we derive a mathematical model for the cardiovascular system of a healthy 1-week-old neonate. Computer simulations of this model result in vital signs that are close to target hemodynamic variables. Simulated systemic arterial pressure waveform and left ventricular pressure-volume loop are realistic, and the system reacts appropriately to blood loss. We also adapt the model structure and change its parameters to reflect the congenital heart defects: patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, complex coarctation of the aorta with patent foramen ovale, and transposition of the great arteries. Simulated vital signs are again close to target hemodynamic variables. The resulting model for neonatal cardiovascular pathophysiology is an essential step in attaining a full-body, model-driven neonatal acute care simulator.},

The extension of simulator-based training into management of basic and critical situations in complex patient populations is natural.

Specifically, we document a stepwise parameter estimation process, explicit simplifying assumptions, and sources for these parameters. The simulated vital signs are within the target hemodynamic variables, and the simulated systemic arterial pressure wave form and left ventricular pressure volume loop are realistic. The system reacts appropriately to blood loss, and incorporation of aortic stenosis is straightforward. This infant cardiovascular model can form the basis for screen-based educational simulations.

@article{Pironet2013,
abstract = {During a full cardiac cycle, the left atrium successively behaves as a reservoir, a conduit and a pump. This complex behavior makes it unrealistic to apply the time-varying elastance theory to characterize the left atrium, first, because this theory has known limitations, and second, because it is still uncertain whether the load independence hypothesis holds. In this study, we aim to bypass this uncertainty by relying on another kind of mathematical model of the cardiac chambers. In the present work, we describe both the left atrium and the left ventricle with a multi-scale model. The multi-scale property of this model comes from the fact that pressure inside a cardiac chamber is derived from a model of the sarcomere behavior. Macroscopic model parameters are identified from reference dog hemodynamic data. The multi-scale model of the cardiovascular system including the left atrium is then simulated to show that the physiological roles of the left atrium are correctly reproduced. This include a biphasic pressure wave and an eight-shaped pressure-volume loop. We also test the validity of our model in non basal conditions by reproducing a preload reduction experiment by inferior vena cava occlusion with the model. We compute the variation of eight indices before and after this experiment and obtain the same variation as experimentally observed for seven out of the eight indices. In summary, the multi-scale mathematical model presented in this work is able to correctly account for the three roles of the left atrium and also exhibits a realistic left atrial pressure-volume loop. Furthermore, the model has been previously presented and validated for the left ventricle. This makes it a proper alternative to the time-varying elastance theory if the focus is set on precisely representing the left atrial and left ventricular behaviors.},

@article{Morley2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Current left ventricular assist devices are designed to provide full hemodynamic support for patients with end-stage failing hearts, but their use has been limited by operative risks, low reliability, and device-related morbidity. Such concerns have resulted in minimum use of left ventricular assist devices for destination therapy. We hypothesize that partial circulatory support, which could be achieved with small pumps implanted with less-invasive procedures, might expand the role of circulatory support devices for treatment of heart failure.

METHODS: We examine the hemodynamic effects of partial left ventricular support using a previously described computational model of the cardiovascular system. Results from simulations were validated by comparison with an in vivo hemodynamic study.

RESULTS: Simulations demonstrated that partial support (2-3 L/min) increased total cardiac output (left ventricular assist device output plus native heart output) by more than 1 L/min and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure by 7 to 10 mm Hg with moderate-to-severe heart failure. Analyses showed that the hemodynamic benefits of increased cardiac output and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure are greater in less-dilated and less-dysfunctional hearts. Both the relationships between ventricular assist device flow and cardiac output and ventricular assist device flow and left atrial pressure predicted by the model closely approximated the same relationships obtained during hemodynamic study in a bovine heart failure model.

CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a pump with a flow rate of 2 to 3 L/min could meaningfully affect cardiac output and blood pressure in patients with advanced compensated heart failure. The development of small devices capable of high reliability and minimal complications that can be implanted with less-invasive techniques is supported by these findings.},

Features retained from the previous editions include short chapters, reference tables, discussion of the relationship between pathophysiology and clinical medicine, and the application of core concepts to clinical examples and real-life situations. Brandon/Hill suggested the 10th edition of the text for both initial purchase and as a part of the small medical library's core collection.

@article{Hunter2004,
abstract = {The IUPS Physiome Project is an internationally collaborative open-source project to provide a public domain framework for computational physiology, including the development of modelling standards, computational tools and web-accessible databases of models of structure and function at all spatial scales. A number of papers in this volume deal with the development of specific mathematical models of physiological processes. This paper stands back from the detail of individual models and reviews the current state of the IUPS Physiome Project including organ and organ system continuum models, the interpretation of constitutive law parameters in terms of micro-structural models, and markup languages for standardizing cellular processes. Some current practical applications of the physiome models are given and some of the challenges for the next 5 years of the Physiome Project at the level of organs, cells and proteins are proposed.},
