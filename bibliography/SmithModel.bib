abstract = {Lumped parameter approaches for modelling the cardiovascular system typically have many parameters of which a significant percentage are often not identifiable from limited data sets. Hence, significant parts of the model are required to be simulated with little overall effect on the accuracy of data fitting, as well as dramatically increasing the complexity of parameter identification. This separates sub-structures of more complex cardiovascular system models to create uniquely identifiable simplified models that are one to one with the measurements. In addition, a new concept of parameter identification is presented where the changes in the parameters are treated as an actuation force into a feed back control system, and the reference output is taken to be steady state values of measured volume and pressure. The major advantage of the method is that when it converges, it must be at the global minimum so that the solution that best fits the data is always found. By utilizing continuous information from the arterial/pulmonary pressure waveforms and the end-diastolic time, it is shown that potentially, the ventricle volume is not required in the data set, which was a requirement in earlier published work. The simplified models can also act as a bridge to identifying more sophisticated cardiac models, by providing an initial set of patient specific parameters that can reveal trends and interactions in the data over time. The goal is to apply the simplified models to retrospective data on groups of patients to help characterize population trends or un-modelled dynamics within known bounds. These trends can assist in improved prediction of patient responses to cardiac disturbance and therapy intervention with potentially smaller and less invasive data sets. In this way a more complex model that takes into account individual patient variation can be developed, and applied to the improvement of cardiovascular management in critical care.},

abstract = {A cardiovascular system (CVS) model has previously been validated in simulated cardiac and circulatory disease states. It has also been shown to accurately capture all main hemodynamic trends in a porcine model of pulmonary embolism. In this research, a slightly extended CVS model and parameter identification process are presented and validated in a porcine experiment of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrations at different volemic levels. The model is extended to more physiologically represent the separation of venous and arterial circulation. Errors for the identified model are within 5\% when re-simulated and compared to clinical data. All identified parameter trends match clinically expected changes. This work represents another clinical validation of the underlying fundamental CVS model, and the methods and approach of using them for cardiovascular diagnosis in critical care.},

abstract = {A previously validated mathematical model of the cardiovascular system (CVS) is made subject-specific using an iterative, proportional gain-based identification method. Prior works utilised a complete set of experimentally measured data that is not clinically typical or applicable. In this paper, parameters are identified using proportional gain-based control and a minimal, clinically available set of measurements. The new method makes use of several intermediary steps through identification of smaller compartmental models of CVS to reduce the number of parameters identified simultaneously and increase the convergence stability of the method. This new, clinically relevant, minimal measurement approach is validated using a porcine model of acute pulmonary embolism (APE). Trials were performed on five pigs, each inserted with three autologous blood clots of decreasing size over a period of four to five hours. All experiments were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty at the University of Liege, Belgium. Continuous aortic and pulmonary artery pressures (P(ao), P(pa)) were measured along with left and right ventricle pressure and volume waveforms. Subject-specific CVS models were identified from global end diastolic volume (GEDV), stroke volume (SV), P(ao), and P(pa) measurements, with the mean volumes and maximum pressures of the left and right ventricles used to verify the accuracy of the fitted models. The inputs (GEDV, SV, P(ao), P(pa)) used in the identification process were matched by the CVS model to errors <0.5\%. Prediction of the mean ventricular volumes and maximum ventricular pressures not used to fit the model compared experimental measurements to median absolute errors of 4.3\% and 4.4\%, which are equivalent to the measurement errors of currently used monitoring devices in the ICU (âˆ¼5-10\%). These results validate the potential for implementing this approach in the intensive care unit.},

abstract = {A minimal cardiac model has been developed which accurately captures the essential dynamics of the cardiovascular system (CVS). However, identifying patient specific parameters with the limited measurements often available, hinders the clinical application of the model for diagnosis and therapy selection. This paper presents an integral-based parameter identification method for fast, accurate identification of patient specific parameters using limited measured data. The integral method turns a previously non-linear and non-convex optimization problem into a linear and convex identification problem. The model includes ventricular interaction and physiological valve dynamics. A healthy human state and four disease states, valvular stenosis, pulmonary embolism, cardiogenic shock and septic shock are used to test the method. Parameters for the healthy and disease states are accurately identified using only discretized flows into and out of the two cardiac chambers, the minimum and maximum volumes of the left and right ventricles, and the pressure waveforms through the aorta and pulmonary artery. These input values can be readily obtained non-invasively using echo-cardiography and ultra-sound, or invasively via catheters that are often used in Intensive Care. The method enables rapid identification of model parameters to match a particular patient condition in clinical real time (3-5 min) to within a mean value of 4-10\% in the presence of 5-15\% uniformly distributed measurement noise. The specific changes made to simulate each disease state are correctly identified in each case to within 10\% without false identification of any other patient specific parameters. Clinically, the resulting patient specific model can then be used to assist medical staff in understanding, diagnosis and treatment selection.},
