abstract = {Published models of excitable cells can be used to fit to a range of action potential experimental data. CellML is a well-defined standard for publishing and exchanging such models, but currently there is a lack of software that utilizes CellML for parameter analysis. In this paper, we introduce a Java-based utility capable of performing model simulation, identifiability analysis, and parameter optimization of ionic cardiac cell models written in CellML. Identifiability analysis was performed in seven CellML models. Parameter identifiability was consistently improved by using the compensatory membrane current as opposed to the membrane voltage as the residual. as well as through the introduction of an additional stimulus set used in the fitting process.},

abstract = {Mathematical models that integrate multi-scale physiological data can offer insight into physiological and pathophysiological function, and may eventually assist in individualized predictive medicine. We present a methodology for performing systematic analyses of multi-parameter interactions in such complex, multi-scale models. Human physiology models are often based on or inspired by Arthur Guyton's whole-body circulatory regulation model. Despite the significance of this model, it has not been the subject of a systematic and comprehensive sensitivity study. Therefore, we use this model as a case study for our methodology. Our analysis of the Guyton model reveals how the multitude of model parameters combine to affect the model dynamics, and how interesting combinations of parameters may be identified. It also includes a "virtual population" from which "virtual individuals" can be chosen, on the basis of exhibiting conditions similar to those of a real-world patient. This lays the groundwork for using the Guyton model for in silico exploration of pathophysiological states and treatment strategies. The results presented here illustrate several potential uses for the entire dataset of sensitivity results and the "virtual individuals" that we have generated, which are included in the supplementary material. More generally, the presented methodology is applicable to modern, more complex multi-scale physiological models.},

abstract = {We present and analyze the behavior of an evolutionary algorithm designed to estimate the parameters of a complex organ behavior model. The model is adaptable to account for patient's specificities. The aim is to finely tune the model to be accurately adapted to various real patient datasets. It can then be embedded, for example, in high fidelity simulations of the human physiology. We present here an application focused on respiration modeling. The algorithm is automatic and adaptive. A compound fitness function has been designed to take into account for various quantities that have to be minimized. The algorithm efficiency is experimentally analyzed on several real test cases: 1) three patient datasets have been acquired with the "breath hold" protocol, and 2) two datasets corresponds to 4-D CT scans. Its performance is compared with two traditional methods (downhill simplex and conjugate gradient descent): a random search and a basic real-valued genetic algorithm. The results show that our evolutionary scheme provides more significantly stable and accurate results.},

abstract = {A mathematical model that provides an overall description of both the short- and long-term mechanisms of arterial pressure regulation is presented. Short-term control is exerted through the baroreceptor reflex while renal elimination plays a role in long-term control. Both mechanisms operate in an integrated way over the compartmental model of the cardiovascular system. The whole system was modelled in MODELICA, which uses a hierarchical object-oriented modelling strategy, under the DYMOLA simulation environment. The performance of the controlled system was analysed by simulation in light of the existing hypothesis and validation tests previously performed with physiological data, demonstrating the effectiveness of both regulation mechanisms under physiological and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {Collaborations in biomedical research and clinical studies require that data, software, and computational resources be shared between geographically distant institutions. In radiology, there is a related issue of sharing remote DICOM data over the Internet. This paper focuses on the problem of federating multiple image data resources such that clients can interact with them as if they are stored in a centralized PACS. We present a toolkit, called VirtualPACS, to support this functionality. Using the toolkit, users can perform standard DICOM operations (query, retrieve, and submit) across distributed image databases. The key features of the toolkit are: (1) VirtualPACS makes it easy to use existing DICOM client applications for data access; (2) it can easily be incorporated into an imaging workflow as a DICOM source; (3) using VirtualPACS, heterogeneous collections of DICOM sources are exposed to clients through a uniform interface and common data model; and (4) DICOM image databases without DICOM messaging can be accessed.},

abstract = {Elastic pressure/volume (P(el) /V) and elastic pressure/resistance (P(el) /R) diagrams reflect parenchymal and bronchial properties, respectively. The objective was to develop a method for determination and mathematical characterization of P(el) /V and P(el) /R relationships, simultaneously studied at sinusoidal flow-modulated vital capacity expirations in a body plethysmograph. Analysis was carried out by iterative parameter estimation based on a composite mathematical model describing a three-segment P(el) /V curve and a hyperbolic P(el) /R curve. The hypothesis was tested that the sigmoid P(el) /V curve is non-symmetric. Thirty healthy subjects were studied. The hypothesis of a non-symmetric P(el) /V curve was verified. Its upper volume asymptote was nearly equal to total lung capacity (TLC), indicating lung stiffness increasing at high lung volume as the main factor limiting TLC at health. The asymptotic minimal resistance of the hyperbolic P(el) /R relationship reflected lung size. A detailed description of both P(el) /V and P(el) /R relationships was simultaneously derived from sinusoidal flow-modulated vital capacity expirations. The nature of the P(el) /V curve merits the use of a non-symmetric P(el) /V model.},

@article{hester2011,
abstract = {Mathematical models and simulations are important tools in discovering key causal relationships governing physiological processes. Simulations guide and improve outcomes of medical interventions involving complex physiology. We developed HumMod, a Windows-based model of integrative human physiology. HumMod consists of 5000 variables describing cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, neural, endocrine, skeletal muscle, and metabolic physiology. The model is constructed from empirical data obtained from peer-reviewed physiological literature. All model details, including variables, parameters, and quantitative relationships, are described in Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. The executable (HumMod.exe) parses the XML and displays the results of the physiological simulations. The XML description of physiology in HumMod's modeling environment allows investigators to add detailed descriptions of human physiology to test new concepts. Additional or revised XML content is parsed and incorporated into the model. The model accurately predicts both qualitative and quantitative changes in clinical and experimental responses. The model is useful in understanding proposed physiological mechanisms and physiological interactions that are not evident, allowing one to observe higher level emergent properties of the complex physiological systems. HumMod has many uses, for instance, analysis of renal control of blood pressure, central role of the liver in creating and maintaining insulin resistance, and mechanisms causing orthostatic hypotension in astronauts. Users simulate different physiological and pathophysiological situations by interactively altering numerical parameters and viewing time-dependent responses. HumMod provides a modeling environment to understand the complex interactions of integrative physiology. HumMod can be downloaded at http://hummod.org.},

We have dozens of completed genomes and an array of high-throughput methods to characterize gene encodings and gene product operation. The question now is how we will assemble the various pieces. In other words, given sufficient information about a living cell's molecular components, can we predict its behavior? We introduce the major classes of cellular processes relevant to modeling, discuss software engineering's role in cell simulation, and identify cell simulation requirements. Our E-Cell project aims to develop the theories, techniques, and software platforms necessary for whole-cell-scale modeling, simulation, and analysis. Since the project's launch in 1996, we have built a variety of cell models, and we are currently developing new models that vary with respect to species, target subsystem, and overall scale.},

abstract = {Because of close anatomic association, the pressure and volume in one ventricle can directly influence the pressure and volume in the opposite ventricle. To examine the importance of ventricular interdependence in controlling the circulation, we developed a computer model in which ventricular interdependence could be turned on and off. Left ventricular chamber contractility, as judged by maximal elastance (Emax), was enhanced on the order of 10\% as a result of ventricular interaction, whereas right ventricular Emax was affected by as much as 60\% under physiological conditions. With increases in systemic vascular resistance, ventricular interaction caused a smaller stroke volume (SV) decrease than with no interaction. For canine data (SV = 21.4 ml), doubling systemic vascular resistance decreased SV by 3.7 without ventricular interdependence, 3.5 with diastolic ventricular interdependence, and 3.3 ml with diastolic and systolic ventricular interdependence. In contrast, with increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, ventricular interaction caused a greater decrease in SV than with no interaction present. Decreasing left ventricular free wall elastance or right ventricular free wall elastance decreased SV. Diastolic ventricular interdependence reduced the SV changes, whereas systolic ventricular interdependence accentuated the SV changes with alterations in right and left ventricular free-wall elastance. The results of the present simulation demonstrate the importance of ventricular interdependence in the observed responses of the right ventricle to volume overload, pressure overload, and ischemia.},

The extension of simulator-based training into management of basic and critical situations in complex patient populations is natural. We describe the derivation of an infant cardiovascular model through the redefinition of a complete set of parameters for an existing adult model. Specifically, we document a stepwise parameter estimation process, explicit simplifying assumptions, and sources for these parameters. The simulated vital signs are within the target hemodynamic variables, and the simulated systemic arterial pressure wave form and left ventricular pressure volume loop are realistic. The system reacts appropriately to blood loss, and incorporation of aortic stenosis is straightforward. This infant cardiovascular model can form the basis for screen-based educational simulations. The model is also an essential step in attaining a full-body, model-driven infant simulator.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the performance of an automatic system for voice pathology detection when the voice samples have been compressed in MP3 format and different binary rates (160, 96, 64, 48, 24, and 8 kb/s). The detectors employ cepstral and noise measurements, along with their derivatives, to characterize the voice signals. The classification is performed using Gaussian mixtures models and support vector machines. The results between the different proposed detectors are compared by means of detector error tradeoff (DET) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, concluding that there are no significant differences in the performance of the detector when the binary rates of the compressed data are above 64 kb/s. This has useful applications in telemedicine, reducing the storage space of voice recordings or transmitting them over narrow-band communications channels.},

@article{Burkhoff1993,
abstract = {One of the most important consequences of acute left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is pulmonary edema resulting from a rise in pulmonary venous pressure (PVP). It is generally believed that the PVP rise is a direct hemodynamic consequence of LVD. While this paradigm seems plausible, especially if the LV is viewed as a sump pump, there is no specific evidence to support this simple explanation. A theoretical analysis was performed to assess the hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for the dramatic rise in PVP after acute LVD. The ventricles were modeled as time-varying elastances; pulmonary and systemic vascular systems were modeled as series of resistive and capacitive elements. In response to a 50\% decrease in LV contractile strength [end-systolic elastance (Ees)], cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped substantially, while PVP increased minimally from its baseline of 12 to approximately 15 mmHg. With LV Ees set at 50\% of normal, the effects of sympathetic activation were tested. When heart rate and total peripheral resistance were increased, CO and MAP improved, yet PVP still did not rise. The only intervention that caused a substantial increase in PVP was to simulate the decrease in unstressed volume (VU) of the venous system known to occur with sympathetic activation. When VU was decreased by about 15-20\% (comparable to experimentally observed shifts with acute heart failure), PVP increased above 25 mmHg. The effects of pericardial constraints were investigated, and the results suggest a major role of this organ in determining the overall hemodynamic response to acute LVD, sympathetic activation, and explaining the responses to therapy. Thus this analysis suggests that elevations of PVP do not occur simply as a direct hemodynamic consequence of acute LVD. Rather, changes in PVP may be dictated more by sympathetic control on venous capacity. If confirmed, recognition of this as a primary mechanism may prove important in directing development of new therapies and in understanding the mechanisms of disease progression in heart failure.},

abstract = {The parameters of wave intensity analysis are calculated from incremental changes in pressure and velocity. While it is clear that forward- and backward-traveling waves induce incremental changes in pressure, not all incremental changes in pressure are due to waves; changes in pressure may also be due to changes in the volume of a compliant structure. When the left ventricular ejects blood rapidly into the aorta, aortic pressure increases, in part, because of the increase in aortic volume: aortic inflow is momentarily greater than aortic outflow. Therefore, to properly quantify the effects of forward or backward waves on arterial pressure and velocity (flow), the component of the incremental change in arterial pressure that is due only to this increase in arterial volume--and not, fundamentally, due to waves--first must be excluded. This component is the pressure generated by the filling and emptying of the reservoir, Otto Frank's Windkessel.},

abstract = {We present the current state of complex circulatory dynamics model development based on Guyton's famous diagram. The aim is to provide an open-source model that will allow the simulation of a number of pathological conditions on a virtual patient including cardiac, respiratory, and kidney failure. The model will also simulate the therapeutic influence of various drugs, infusions of electrolytes, blood transfusion, etc. As a current result of implementation, we describe a core model of human physiology targeting the systemic circulation, arterial pressure and body fluid regulation, including short- and long-term regulations. The model can be used for educational purposes and general reflection on physiological regulation in pathogenesis of various diseases.},

abstract = {The last decade has generated extensive information on the genetic and molecular basis of disease. A major challenge remains the integration of this information into the physiological environment of the functioning cell and tissue. This article illustrates the use of computational biology in meeting this challenge in the context of cardiac excitation and arrhythmia. (1) Genetics to Cell Function: Mutations that alter the kinetics of the cardiac sodium channel, INa, give rise to a congenital form of the long QT syndrome that can lead to sudden death. Using a computer modelof the cardiac cell, we simulated the effects of the mutations on the action potential, demonstrating its prolongation at slowrate and the develop-rate and the development of arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations due to reactivation of L-type Ca channels, ICa(L) [Clancy and Rudy, Nature (London) 400:566, 1999]. (2) Multicellular Tissue: Slow conduction is an important property of propagation arrhythmias (reentry). Very slow conduction is supported by reduced intercellular coupling through gap junctions. Using a multicellular fiber model, we have shown that slow conduction is very stable and, in contrast to normal conduction which depends solely on INa, requires a major contribution from ICa(L) (Shaw and Rudy, Circ. Res. 81:727, 1997).},

abstract = {The metabolic syndrome, a cluster of factors linked to obesity that contribute to risk for atherosclerosis and Type 2 diabetes, may affect 20-25\% of the adults in the United States. We designed a medical physiology laboratory to evaluate and discuss the physiological and nutritional principles involved in the metabolic syndrome. The five criteria used to diagnose this syndrome (fasting blood triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose, blood pressure, central obesity) were measured by students on each other either previously or during this exercise. In addition, to illustrate nutritional factors involved in causation and treatment of the metabolic syndrome, a meal was provided during the laboratory. Class members were randomized to groups allowed ad libitum meal composition, or constrained to the National Cholesterol Education Program Step I or Step II diets. The composition of the diet (including saturated fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, and carbohydrate content) was discussed in the context of blood cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels. This laboratory allows a comprehensive analysis of the physiological and nutritional factors involved in the development of the metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {The initiation of osteoarthritis (OA) has been linked to the onset and progression of pathologic mechanisms at the cartilage-bone interface. Most importantly, this degenerative disease involves cross-talk between the cartilage and subchondral bone environments, so an informative model should contain the complete complex. In order to evaluate this process, we have developed a multiscale model using the open-source ontologies developed for the Physiome Project with cartilage and bone descriptions at the cellular, micro, and macro levels. In this way, we can effectively model the influence of whole body loadings at the macro level and the influence of bone organization and architecture at the micro level, and have cell level processes that determine bone and cartilage remodeling. Cell information is then passed up the spatial scales to modify micro architecture and provide a macro spatial characterization of cartilage inflammation. We evaluate the framework by linking a common knee injury (anterior cruciate ligament deficiency) to proinflammatory mediators as a possible pathway to initiate OA. This framework provides a "virtual bone-cartilage" tool for evaluating hypotheses, treatment effects, and disease onset to inform and strengthen clinical studies.},

abstract = {Full-body patient simulators provide a technological basis for clinical education without risk to real patients. In a previous study, we described a model for educational simulation of infant cardiovascular physiology. Using essentially the same methodology, we derive a mathematical model for the cardiovascular system of a healthy 1-week-old neonate. Computer simulations of this model result in vital signs that are close to target hemodynamic variables. Simulated systemic arterial pressure waveform and left ventricular pressure-volume loop are realistic, and the system reacts appropriately to blood loss. We also adapt the model structure and change its parameters to reflect the congenital heart defects: patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, complex coarctation of the aorta with patent foramen ovale, and transposition of the great arteries. Simulated vital signs are again close to target hemodynamic variables. The resulting model for neonatal cardiovascular pathophysiology is an essential step in attaining a full-body, model-driven neonatal acute care simulator.},

abstract = {The present study assessed (1) the impact of the measurement site (lower versus upper extremity) on the corresponding compliance variables and (2) the overall reliability of diastolic pulse contour (Windkessel-derived) analysis in normal and hypertensive subjects. Arterial tonograms were recorded in the supine position from the radial and posterior tibial arteries in 20 normotensive (116\{+/-\}12/68\{+/-\}8 mm Hg) and 27 essential hypertensive subjects (160\{+/-\}16/94\{+/-\}14 mm Hg). Ensemble-averaged data for each subject were fitted to a first-order lumped-parameter model (basic Windkessel) to compute whole-body arterial compliance (CA) and to a third-order lumped-parameter model (modified Windkessel) to compute proximal compliance (C1) and distal compliance (C2). Despite high-fidelity waveforms in each subject, the first-order Windkessel model did not yield interpretable (positive) values for CA in 50\% of normotensives and 41\% of hypertensives, whereas the third-order model failed to yield interpretable C1 or C2 results in 15\% of normotensives and 41\% of hypertensives. No between-site correlations were found for the first-order time constant, 2 of the 3 third-order model curve-fitting constants, or CA, C1, or C2 (P>0.50). Mean values for all 3 compliance variables were higher for the leg than the arm (P<0.05 each). We conclude that differences in Windkessel-derived compliance values in the arm and leg invalidate whole-body model assumptions and suggest a strong influence of regional circulatory properties. The validity and utility of Windkessel-derived variables is further diminished by the absence of between-site correlations and the common occurrence of uninterpretable values in hypertensive subjects.},

Nevertheless, object-oriented modeling is spreading in current simulation environments through the use of the individual components of the model and its interconnections to define the underlying dynamic equations. In this paper we describe the use of the SIMSCAPE™ simulation environment in the object-oriented modeling of the closed loop cardiovascular system.

abstract = {A modular numerical model of the cardiovascular system has been developed to reproduce the most important circulatory phenomena in terms of pressure and volume relationships. It is an easy tool to use, designed to be used with a friendly approach on any IBM or compatible personal computer: it offers a wide selection of graphical and numerical outputs and can be rearranged easily for a particular experiment. A set of subroutines related to different circulatory phenomena has been developed; they can be assembled easily together and communicate with each other by two variables. A full description of the existing subroutines is presented in this paper with three different application examples resulting from the rearrangement of the existing software modules: the first concerns the behaviour of natural ventricle model itself and can be regarded as a ventricle stand-alone characterization test in terms of preload and afterload sensitivities, the second is related to the use of a pneumatic ventricle instead of the model of the natural ventricle, and the third is a full model of the cardiocirculatory system.},

We present a novel purity system for Java that employs purity annotations which can be checked modularly. This is done using a flow-sensitive, intraprocedural analysis. The system exploits two properties, called freshness and locality , to increase the range of methods that can be considered pure. JPure also includes an inference engine for annotating legacy code. We evaluate our system against several packages from the Java Standard Library. Our results indicate it is possible to uncover significant amounts of purity efficiently.},

@article{Morley2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Current left ventricular assist devices are designed to provide full hemodynamic support for patients with end-stage failing hearts, but their use has been limited by operative risks, low reliability, and device-related morbidity. Such concerns have resulted in minimum use of left ventricular assist devices for destination therapy. We hypothesize that partial circulatory support, which could be achieved with small pumps implanted with less-invasive procedures, might expand the role of circulatory support devices for treatment of heart failure.

METHODS: We examine the hemodynamic effects of partial left ventricular support using a previously described computational model of the cardiovascular system. Results from simulations were validated by comparison with an in vivo hemodynamic study.

RESULTS: Simulations demonstrated that partial support (2-3 L/min) increased total cardiac output (left ventricular assist device output plus native heart output) by more than 1 L/min and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure by 7 to 10 mm Hg with moderate-to-severe heart failure. Analyses showed that the hemodynamic benefits of increased cardiac output and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure are greater in less-dilated and less-dysfunctional hearts. Both the relationships between ventricular assist device flow and cardiac output and ventricular assist device flow and left atrial pressure predicted by the model closely approximated the same relationships obtained during hemodynamic study in a bovine heart failure model.

CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a pump with a flow rate of 2 to 3 L/min could meaningfully affect cardiac output and blood pressure in patients with advanced compensated heart failure. The development of small devices capable of high reliability and minimal complications that can be implanted with less-invasive techniques is supported by these findings.},

abstract = {Over the last 10 years, 'Systems Biology' has focused on the integration of biology and medicine with information technology and computation. The current challenge is to use the discoveries of the last 20 years, such as genomics and proteomics, to develop targeted therapeutical strategies. These strategies are the result of understanding the aetiologies of complex diseases. Scientists predict the data will make personalized medicine rapidly available. However, the data need to be considered as a highly complex system comprising multiple inputs and feedback mechanisms. Translational medicine requires the functional and conceptual linkage of genetics to proteins, proteins to cells, cells to organs, organs to systems and systems to the organism. To help understand the complex integration of these systems, a mathematical model of the entire human body, which accurately links the functioning of all organs and systems together, could provide a framework for the development and testing of new hypotheses that will be important in clinical outcomes. There are several efforts to develop a 'Human Physiome', with the strengths and weaknesses of each being presented here. The development of a 'Human Model', with verification, documentation and validation of the underlying and integrative responses, is essential to provide a usable environment. Future development of a 'Human Model' requires integrative physiologists working in collaboration with other scientists, who have expertise in all areas of human biology, to develop the most accurate and usable human model.},

@article{Pironet2013,
abstract = {During a full cardiac cycle, the left atrium successively behaves as a reservoir, a conduit and a pump. This complex behavior makes it unrealistic to apply the time-varying elastance theory to characterize the left atrium, first, because this theory has known limitations, and second, because it is still uncertain whether the load independence hypothesis holds. In this study, we aim to bypass this uncertainty by relying on another kind of mathematical model of the cardiac chambers. In the present work, we describe both the left atrium and the left ventricle with a multi-scale model. The multi-scale property of this model comes from the fact that pressure inside a cardiac chamber is derived from a model of the sarcomere behavior. Macroscopic model parameters are identified from reference dog hemodynamic data. The multi-scale model of the cardiovascular system including the left atrium is then simulated to show that the physiological roles of the left atrium are correctly reproduced. This include a biphasic pressure wave and an eight-shaped pressure-volume loop. We also test the validity of our model in non basal conditions by reproducing a preload reduction experiment by inferior vena cava occlusion with the model. We compute the variation of eight indices before and after this experiment and obtain the same variation as experimentally observed for seven out of the eight indices. In summary, the multi-scale mathematical model presented in this work is able to correctly account for the three roles of the left atrium and also exhibits a realistic left atrial pressure-volume loop. Furthermore, the model has been previously presented and validated for the left ventricle. This makes it a proper alternative to the time-varying elastance theory if the focus is set on precisely representing the left atrial and left ventricular behaviors.},

@article{Summers2010,
abstract = {Background: A tendency to develop reentry orthostasis after a prolonged exposure to microgravity is a common problem among astronauts. The problem is 5 times more prevalent in female astronauts as compared to their male counterparts. The mechanisms responsible for this gender differentiation are poorly understood despite many detailed and complex investigations directed toward an analysis of the physiologic control systems involved. Methods: In this study, a series of computer simulation studies using a mathematical model of cardiovascular functioning were performed to examine the proposed hypothesis that this phenomenon could be explained by basic physical forces acting through the simple common anatomic differences between men and women. In the computer simulations, the circulatory components and hydrostatic gradients of the model were allowed to adapt to the physical constraints of microgravity. After a simulated period of one month, the model was returned to the conditions of earth's gravity and the standard postflight tilt test protocol was performed while the model output depicting the typical vital signs was monitored. Conclusions: The analysis demonstrated that a 15\% lowering of the longitudinal center of gravity in the anatomic structure of the model was all that was necessary to prevent the physiologic compensatory mechanisms from overcoming the propensity for reentry orthostasis leading to syncope.},

abstract = {Because of close anatomic association, the pressure and volume in one ventricle can directly influence the pressure and volume in the opposite ventricle. To examine the importance of ventricular interdependence in controlling the circulation, we developed a computer model in which ventricular interdependence could be turned on and off. Left ventricular chamber contractility, as judged by maximal elastance (Emax), was enhanced on the order of 10\% as a result of ventricular interaction, whereas right ventricular Emax was affected by as much as 60\% under physiological conditions. With increases in systemic vascular resistance, ventricular interaction caused a smaller stroke volume (SV) decrease than with no interaction. For canine data (SV = 21.4 ml), doubling systemic vascular resistance decreased SV by 3.7 without ventricular interdependence, 3.5 with diastolic ventricular interdependence, and 3.3 ml with diastolic and systolic ventricular interdependence. In contrast, with increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, ventricular interaction caused a greater decrease in SV than with no interaction present. Decreasing left ventricular free wall elastance or right ventricular free wall elastance decreased SV. Diastolic ventricular interdependence reduced the SV changes, whereas systolic ventricular interdependence accentuated the SV changes with alterations in right and left ventricular free-wall elastance. The results of the present simulation demonstrate the importance of ventricular interdependence in the observed responses of the right ventricle to volume overload, pressure overload, and ischemia.},

@article{Burkhoff1993,
abstract = {One of the most important consequences of acute left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is pulmonary edema resulting from a rise in pulmonary venous pressure (PVP). It is generally believed that the PVP rise is a direct hemodynamic consequence of LVD. While this paradigm seems plausible, especially if the LV is viewed as a sump pump, there is no specific evidence to support this simple explanation. A theoretical analysis was performed to assess the hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for the dramatic rise in PVP after acute LVD. The ventricles were modeled as time-varying elastances; pulmonary and systemic vascular systems were modeled as series of resistive and capacitive elements. In response to a 50\% decrease in LV contractile strength [end-systolic elastance (Ees)], cardiac output (CO) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped substantially, while PVP increased minimally from its baseline of 12 to approximately 15 mmHg. With LV Ees set at 50\% of normal, the effects of sympathetic activation were tested. When heart rate and total peripheral resistance were increased, CO and MAP improved, yet PVP still did not rise. The only intervention that caused a substantial increase in PVP was to simulate the decrease in unstressed volume (VU) of the venous system known to occur with sympathetic activation. When VU was decreased by about 15-20\% (comparable to experimentally observed shifts with acute heart failure), PVP increased above 25 mmHg. The effects of pericardial constraints were investigated, and the results suggest a major role of this organ in determining the overall hemodynamic response to acute LVD, sympathetic activation, and explaining the responses to therapy. Thus this analysis suggests that elevations of PVP do not occur simply as a direct hemodynamic consequence of acute LVD. Rather, changes in PVP may be dictated more by sympathetic control on venous capacity. If confirmed, recognition of this as a primary mechanism may prove important in directing development of new therapies and in understanding the mechanisms of disease progression in heart failure.},

@article{Pironet2013a,
abstract = {During a full cardiac cycle, the left atrium successively behaves as a reservoir, a conduit and a pump. This complex behavior makes it unrealistic to apply the time-varying elastance theory to characterize the left atrium, first, because this theory has known limitations, and second, because it is still uncertain whether the load independence hypothesis holds. In this study, we aim to bypass this uncertainty by relying on another kind of mathematical model of the cardiac chambers. In the present work, we describe both the left atrium and the left ventricle with a multi-scale model. The multi-scale property of this model comes from the fact that pressure inside a cardiac chamber is derived from a model of the sarcomere behavior. Macroscopic model parameters are identified from reference dog hemodynamic data. The multi-scale model of the cardiovascular system including the left atrium is then simulated to show that the physiological roles of the left atrium are correctly reproduced. This include a biphasic pressure wave and an eight-shaped pressure-volume loop. We also test the validity of our model in non basal conditions by reproducing a preload reduction experiment by inferior vena cava occlusion with the model. We compute the variation of eight indices before and after this experiment and obtain the same variation as experimentally observed for seven out of the eight indices. In summary, the multi-scale mathematical model presented in this work is able to correctly account for the three roles of the left atrium and also exhibits a realistic left atrial pressure-volume loop. Furthermore, the model has been previously presented and validated for the left ventricle. This makes it a proper alternative to the time-varying elastance theory if the focus is set on precisely representing the left atrial and left ventricular behaviors.},

abstract = {Mathematical models and simulations are important tools in discovering key causal relationships governing physiological processes. Simulations guide and improve outcomes of medical interventions involving complex physiology. We developed HumMod, a Windows-based model of integrative human physiology. HumMod consists of 5000 variables describing cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, neural, endocrine, skeletal muscle, and metabolic physiology. The model is constructed from empirical data obtained from peer-reviewed physiological literature. All model details, including variables, parameters, and quantitative relationships, are described in Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. The executable (HumMod.exe) parses the XML and displays the results of the physiological simulations. The XML description of physiology in HumMod's modeling environment allows investigators to add detailed descriptions of human physiology to test new concepts. Additional or revised XML content is parsed and incorporated into the model. The model accurately predicts both qualitative and quantitative changes in clinical and experimental responses. The model is useful in understanding proposed physiological mechanisms and physiological interactions that are not evident, allowing one to observe higher level emergent properties of the complex physiological systems. HumMod has many uses, for instance, analysis of renal control of blood pressure, central role of the liver in creating and maintaining insulin resistance, and mechanisms causing orthostatic hypotension in astronauts. Users simulate different physiological and pathophysiological situations by interactively altering numerical parameters and viewing time-dependent responses. HumMod provides a modeling environment to understand the complex interactions of integrative physiology. HumMod can be downloaded at http://hummod.org.},
