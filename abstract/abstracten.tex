\textbf{Abstract:}

Two work presents results, which are researched in the field of utilization technology who offers distributed computing and storage capacity to exchange medical information, demanding computation and data exchange. Next to the GRID technology. The virtualization technology evolved and were utilized more massively next to the GRID technology and these gives distributed systems a new quality and services called today with the name CLOUD. This work summarizes result of different projects which implements selected technologies in the field of GRID and CLOUD to systems which are used in medical education and research and in neighboring fields. The multidisciplinary projects were solved within the cooperation between association CESNET, First Faculty of Medicine of Charles University in Prague and Academy of Performing Arts in Prague.
