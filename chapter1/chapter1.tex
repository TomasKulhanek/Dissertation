\chapter{Introduction}

The \emph{grid-computing} is usually defined as sharing computational and data storage resources across organizational boundaries. In recent years, the development of virtualization technologies enhances the availability of services provided by grid-computing and additionally enabled an evolution of so called \emph{cloud-computing}, which can utilize virtual environment on real powerful computing infrastructure too. Based on the development of technologies and also philosophy of providing them to end users, this thesis focus on multidisciplinary research related to grid-computing as well as to cloud-computing and it's utilization in biomedical research and application related to processing of medical information.

The term "medical information" is too wide and further work focuses on the following selected areas, which were part of:
(1) exchange and processing of medical images, (2) analysis of human voice and (3) modeling and simulation of human physiology. %This work focuses on processing of medical information should give enhanced information, which can be analysed easily. Thus further analysis or synthesis of such information is beyond this work, so the aim is not to give particular results on some specific diseasies, pathologies etc., however, with cooperation of other experts it is a desired side effect.
