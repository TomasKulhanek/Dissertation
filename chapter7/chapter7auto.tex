\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In previous chapters, there were introduced different methods available for selected use cases in research in biology and medicine. 
%\section{Virtual Infrastructure}
%\label{sec:resultsinfrastructure}
As each of the use cases and available system was proposed on different operating system platform, different architecture and or different middleware the virtualization was utilized to build the virtual infrastructures for purposes of each project. The paper \cite{kulhanek2010c} \emph{Infrastructure for Data Storage and Computation in Biomedical Research} in Appendix~\ref{app:infrastructure} describes result of establishing the virtualization on physical infrastructure to share computational power among different platforms.
